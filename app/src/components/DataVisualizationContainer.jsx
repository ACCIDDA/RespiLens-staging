              The NHSN dataset contains ~300 columns for plotting data with a
              variety of scales, including hospitalization admission counts,
              percent of admissions by pathogen, hospitalization rates per 100k,
              raw bed capacity numbers, bed capacity percents, and absolute
              percentage of change. On RespiLens, you can use the timeseries
              unit selector to switch between data scales and view similar
              columns on the same plot.
